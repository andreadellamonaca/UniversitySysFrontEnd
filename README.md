# ProjectFE

A system of applications has been designed and developed within a university system. It consists of 2 applications: (i) a
web app usable by the secretaries to manage the data of the domain (classrooms, teachers, courses, lessons, etc.) and the
reports made by teachers, who in addition to report problems to the secretariat (small classrooms, faulty devices, etc..) or
view those already present in the system, can upload teaching material (pdf, images, links, bibliography, etc..); (ii) a
mobile app that can be used by students to receive notifications when the teachers upload teaching materials, download
the teaching materials or provide an evaluation from 1 to 5 for each lesson or teaching material; teachers receive
notifications about changes in the status of the reports or a new evaluation by the students. In addition, both teachers and
students use the mobile app to communicate via course chat rooms, view the lessons of the day, or receive notifications of
lesson changes.

This project is the FrontEnd of the university system and it was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
